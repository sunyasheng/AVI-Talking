## Contribute to INFERNO 

If you would like to contribute to the INFERNO library, you can start by creating a small submodule repo (a sandbox) with your new classes (datasets, models, ...). 

When your project is finished, create a PR. We will be happy to merge it into INFERNO.

If you also want to contribute with a new "app", (such as end-to-end training mechanism for a new network with a new task), please create an "app" sub repo. Please refer to the [these instructions](../../inferno_apps/sandbox_apps/README.md).
