## Building your own INFERNO "sandbox app" 

If you want to use inferno to train a new type of network, this folder is the perfect place to create a git submodule repo and put your app-related scripts (such as data processing, training and configs). In there. 

If you also want to contribute to new models, datasets, etc, into INFERNO please refer to the [these instructions](../../inferno/sandboxes/README.md).
